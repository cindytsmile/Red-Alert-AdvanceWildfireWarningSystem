# Red-Alert-AdvanceWildfireWarningSystem
Call for Code Entry 2019

This advance warning system will use data analysis to monitor fire prone areas for indicators. Inputs will be data readings from Project Lali (2018 Second Place Call for Code winner) and National Weather Service Data. Take Southern California as the example. When conditions are prime for wildfires (need to research parameters), Watson will trigger drones (supplied by a third party) to fly grids and transmit images back to the cloud for visual processing. If Watson detects a possible smoke column (80 percent chance), Watson will drop a pin on that location in Google Maps and push an alert notification with a link to google maps.
